# Involute Gear Generator for Houdini

I made a quick and dirty Involute Gear Generator for Houdini. 

Here is a preview video in action -> https://youtu.be/oZCiq5kJx24

The object's face poly will break in certain conditions, such as insufficient segments, inaccurate profile shift for the number of teeth generated, or too large of a pressure angle. Play with the parameters until the face poly is clean. 

At some point, I plan to revisit it and create a proportional system so it can never break this way, but currently, I have no time to spend on it anymore and have to use and share it as it is.

No support is provided, so please keep this in mind and use it as it is. 

Get the HDA and install it as any other Houdini HDA.

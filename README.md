# Involute Gear Generator for Houdini

I made a quick and dirty Involute Gear Generator for Houdini. 

Here is a preview video in action -> https://youtu.be/oZCiq5kJx24

The face poly of the object will brake in certain conditions such as not enough segments, inacurate profile shift for the number of teeth generated or too large of a presure angle, so play with the parameters until the face poly are clean. 

At some point I plan to revisit it and create proportianal system so it can never brake this way, but curently I have no time to spend on it anymore and have to use and share it as it is.

No support is provided, so please keep this in mind and use it as it is. 

Get the HDA and install it as any other Houdini HDA.
